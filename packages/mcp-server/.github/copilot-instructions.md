# GitHub Copilot Instructions

> Generated by Cortex Memory System - 2026-01-09

## Project Overview
This project uses Cortex for persistent AI memory across sessions.

## Coding Guidelines

### Memory Integration
- Query `cortex_context` before implementing features
- Save architectural decisions with `cortex_add`
- Document "why" not just "what" in commits

### Workflow
1. **Explore** - Read relevant files first
2. **Plan** - Think through approach before coding
3. **Code** - Incremental changes with checkpoints
4. **Verify** - Run tests after each change
5. **Commit** - Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:)

### Code Style
- Follow project coding conventions
- Use descriptive variable names
- Write tests for new features
- Keep functions focused and small

### Anti-Patterns
- Never log secrets or PII
- Never commit without tests
- Never skip code review
- Never hardcode credentials
