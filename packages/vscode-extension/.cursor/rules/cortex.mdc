# Cortex Memory Protocol

## Memory-First Development

At session start: `cortex_context("task summary")`
Save decisions: `cortex_add(content, type)`

## Workflow

```
EXPLORE → PLAN → CODE → VERIFY → COMMIT
```

## Extended Thinking

| Keyword | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| think | Simple decisions |
| think hard | Complex logic |
| ultrathink | Architecture |

## Rules

- Query memory before implementing
- Save architectural decisions
- Use conventional commits
- Never log secrets or PII
