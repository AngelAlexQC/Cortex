# Cortex Governance Model

## Overview
Cortex is an open-source project managed by the **EcuaByte Core Team**. We believe in "Benevolent Dictatorship" for architectural vision, coupled with "Community Democracy" for feature implementation.

## Roles

### 1. Steering Committee (EcuaByte)
- **Responsibility**: Strategic direction, branding, and major architectural decisions (e.g., database changes, protocol versioning).
- **Veto Power**: Yes, extending to anything that compromises security or stability.

### 2. Maintainers
- **Responsibility**: Triage issues, review PRs, maintain documentation.
- **Access**: Write access to the repository.
- **Selection**: Active contributors invited by the Steering Committee.

### 3. Contributors
- **Responsibility**: Submit PRs, report bugs, improve docs.

## Decision Making
- **Minor Changes**: Lazy consensus (if no one objects in 72h, it merges).
- **Major Changes**: RFC (Request for Comments) process required.

## Roadmap
The roadmap is defined publicly in `ROADMAP.md` but prioritization is determined by the Steering Committee based on the needs of the Cortex ecosystem.
